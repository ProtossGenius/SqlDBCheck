# DBCheck

#### Project Introduction
SQLite DBCheck

#### Software Architecture

Java+Js
For the time being, only the code that tests SQLite is done, and then it will be expanded.

#### Installation Tutorial

I don't know how to describe it, I should pull it down, then I can open it with ide. I use the idea.

#### Instructions for use

1. Configure ./configs/check_ctrl.cfg
2. Write the js script in scrptDirectory. See the example for details.
3. Use a method similar to "java -cp ./out/artifacts/SqlDBCheck_jar/SqlDBCheck.jar com.suremoon.dbcheck.Main -classpath ./libs" to start running. After -classpath, add the jar path that the database depends on.
4. More content will be written to the wiki.
